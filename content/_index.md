title: Oxford Folk Festival is back! 
---


Following in the footsteps of the brilliant work of Folk Weekend: Oxford and Oxford Folk Festival’s prior incarnation, the city of dreaming spires will once again be filled with the sounds of traditional music and dance this Spring.

We’re excited to announce that Eliza Carthy MBE will be performing as our Saturday headliner, in partnership with the North Wall Arts Centre. We can’t announce our Friday headliner just yet, but we promise it will be worth the wait!

In addition to our gigs, there will be:

 - **Morris and Rapper** at multiple locations across the city. The lineup in previous years has included the Ashmolean Museum and the iconic 18th century Radcliffe Camera
 -  A **full weekend session trail** across the city spanning all of the traditions enjoyed in the UK
 -  **Ceilidhs and dances** from our friends and partners Oxfolk
 - **Performances across four stages** showcasing the talented performers of our city and its surrounds

We can’t wait to welcome you here on Friday April 19th!

## Travel

We recommend that you travel to OFF by train or by using the Park and Rides located around the city: https://www.oxford.gov.uk/parkandridesites

If you are coming from London, the Oxford Tube offers a 24/7 return service between Oxford and London for £21 at full price, with no booking required.

Taxis in Oxford can be booked easily via the 001 or Royal Cars apps.

## Accommodation

**Hotels:** You should be able to get two nights in a hotel or airbnb for between £60 and £120 for the weekend if you book soon. The cheapest options tend to be located just north of the city, and there are frequent bus options to get into the action within half an hour. 

**Camping:** There are no campsites within the city itself, but there are several within 5 miles. Valley Farm is the closest and easiest to reach via the E1 bus, which runs until 1.25am on the Saturday night. They charge £20 a night for a pitch for two people in a 5m tent (£5 extra for each additional person), or £100 a night for a pre-pitched 4-person bell tent.
